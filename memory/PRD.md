## Latest Updates (March 2026)

### Session Mar 10, 2026 - Comprehensive Historical Import & LTV Tracking

#### Feature: Comprehensive Historical Import System (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** Need to import 950 historical students with proper assignments to Sales agents, CS agents, and Mentors.

**Solution:** Created a multi-import system with LTV tracking:

**1. Comprehensive Students Import** (`/api/import/comprehensive-students`)
Fields: student_name*, phone*, additional_numbers, email*, country, city, enrolled_course*, enrollment_amount, enrollment_date, sales_agent_employee_id*, team_name*, cs_agent_employee_id*, mentor_employee_id

Creates:
- Lead as "Enrolled" (assigned to Sales Agent)
- Student as "Activated" in CS (assigned to CS Agent)
- Mentor assignment (if provided)
- Initial LTV transaction record

**2. CS Upgrades Import** (`/api/import/cs-upgrades`)
Fields: month*, date*, cs_employee_id*, student_email*, upgrade_amount*, upgrade_to_course
- Tracks all upgrade transactions per CS agent
- Updates student upgrade_count and upgrade_history
- Adds to student LTV

**3. Mentor Redeposits Import** (`/api/import/mentor-redeposits`)
Fields: month*, date*, mentor_employee_id*, student_email*, redeposit_amount*
- Tracks redeposit transactions per mentor
- Student moves back to "discussion_started" for re-pitching
- Monthly totals reset at beginning of each month
- Adds to student LTV

**4. Mentor Withdrawals Import** (`/api/import/mentor-withdrawals`)
Fields: date*, mentor_employee_id*, student_email*, withdrawal_amount*, notes
- For Admin/Financier to add daily/backdated withdrawal entries
- Reduces active revenue for mentor
- Net = Redeposits - Withdrawals
- Used for commission calculations
- Subtracts from student LTV

**5. LTV Tracking System**
- New collection: `student_transactions` - tracks ALL financial events
- Each student has: first_enrollment_amount, total_upgrades, total_redeposits, total_withdrawals, ltv
- API: `GET /api/student/{student_id}/ltv` - returns complete LTV breakdown

**6. Mentor Revenue Summary** (`/api/mentor/revenue-summary`)
- Shows: Monthly Redeposits | Withdrawals | Net Active | Students Pitched
- Holistic view for commission calculation

**Frontend Changes:**
- Sales: "Import Historical Students" button (comprehensive import)
- CS: "Import Upgrades" button added
- Mentor: "Import Redeposits" + "Import Withdrawals" buttons
- Mentor: Revenue summary card shows Redeposits, Withdrawals, Net Active

#### CS Kanban - "Upgraded" Stage (COMPLETED)
- Added "Upgraded" stage after "Interested" in CS kanban
- Stages: New Student → Activated → Satisfactory Call → Pitched Upgrade → In Progress → Interested → Upgraded → Not Interested

### Session Mar 10, 2026 - Customer Service Upgrade Workflow + HR Enhancements

#### Feature 1: Visual Upgrade Path Indicator (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** CS agents and mentors needed a visual way to see a student's journey through course levels.

- Supports compact mode for smaller displays

**Location:** Student Detail Modal in Customer Service page

#### Feature 2: Welcome Email for New Employees (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** New employees needed a professional onboarding email with their credentials and employment details.

**Solution:** Implemented automatic welcome email on employee creation:

**Email Template Includes:**
- CLT Synapse header with logo
- User ID (company email) and password
- Employee ID, Date of Joining, Tenure
- Department, Designation, System Role
- HR Manager signature (name, email, phone from employee master)
- Login button to CLT Synapse portal
- Security warning to change password

**API:** `POST /api/hr/employees/with-user` 
- Now returns `welcome_email_sent: true/false`
- Message includes email status confirmation

**Technical Implementation:**
- `get_employee_welcome_template()` in email_service.py
- `send_employee_welcome_email()` helper function
- `calculate_tenure_text()` for human-readable tenure

**Test Results:** Backend 100% (9/9 tests), Frontend 100%

#### P0: Customer Service Upgrade Workflow (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** Needed a workflow for existing students to upgrade their course, with proper tracking and mentor visibility.

**Solution:** Implemented complete upgrade workflow:

**1. Backend Implementation:**
- `POST /api/students/{id}/initiate-upgrade` - Creates upgrade record, moves student back to new_student stage
- `POST /api/students/{id}/complete-upgrade-activation` - Completes the upgrade activation process
- `GET /api/students/{id}/upgrade-history` - Returns complete upgrade history
- Student tracks: `is_upgraded_student`, `upgrade_count`, `upgrade_history`, `mt5_account_history`
- Mentor gets notified but student NOT counted as new (preserves metrics)

**2. Frontend Implementation:**
- `UpgradeModal.jsx` - Full upgrade form with course selection, MT5 tracking, wallet confirmation
- Course color-coding: `getCourseColor()` function maps courses to colors (mastery=emerald, advanced=green, etc.)
- Upgrade badge shows "↑ xN" on student cards for upgraded students
- "Initiate Upgrade" menu option only appears for students in "activated" stage

**3. Key Features:**
- Mandatory course selection for upgrade
- MT5 account change tracking (history preserved)

- Previous questionnaire data preserved and pre-filled
- Student stays with same mentor after upgrade

**Bugs Fixed During Testing:**
1. localStorage key: Changed from 'token' to 'clt_token'
2. Course price display: Now uses `(course.price || course.base_price)`
3. Dark mode visibility: Wallet checkbox styling fixed

**Test Results:** Backend 100% (12/12 tests), Frontend 100%

- commission_settlements (Money Out)
- finance_verifications (Money In from enrollments)

### Session Mar 6, 2026 - P0 Finance & BioCloud Fixes

#### P0: ObjectId Serialization Fix (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** Finance Settings CRUD endpoints were crashing due to MongoDB `ObjectId` not being JSON serializable when creating new entries.

**Solution:** Fixed the Bank Accounts POST endpoint (`/api/finance/settings/bank-accounts`) that was missing `account.pop("_id", None)` before returning. All Finance Settings POST endpoints now properly remove the `_id` field.

**Verification:** Testing agent confirmed all 7 CRUD endpoints working without ObjectId errors:
- POST /api/finance/settings/chart-of-accounts ✅
- POST /api/finance/settings/cost-centers ✅  
- POST /api/finance/settings/payment-methods ✅
- POST /api/finance/settings/payment-gateways ✅
- POST /api/finance/settings/psp-bank-mapping ✅
- POST /api/finance/settings/bank-accounts ✅
- POST /api/finance/vendors ✅

#### P0: BioCloud Attendance Sync Reliability Improvement (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** BioCloud web scraping was unreliable, failing intermittently without proper error handling.

**Solution:** Enhanced the sync mechanism with:
1. **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry count (default 3 attempts) with 2-second delays
2. **Robust Element Selection**: Multiple fallback selectors for login form, menus, and tables
3. **Better Error Handling**: Detailed logging and informative error messages
4. **Date Filter Support**: Can sync specific dates if BioCloud supports filtering
5. **Sync History Logging**: All syncs logged to `biocloud_sync_log` collection

**New Endpoints Added:**
- `POST /api/hr/biocloud/bulk-sync` - Sync attendance for a date range (max 31 days) in background
- `GET /api/hr/biocloud/sync-job/{job_id}` - Check bulk sync job status
- `GET /api/hr/biocloud/sync-history` - View sync history for audit/troubleshooting

**Enhanced Status Endpoint:** `/api/hr/biocloud/status` now includes last successful sync information.

**Test Results:** Backend 100% (17/17 tests), Frontend 100%

#### P1: Email Notifications for SLA Breaches & Daily Finance Report (COMPLETED)

#### P0: Finance Dashboard & Cash Flow Transparency (COMPLETED)
**Requirement:** Finance dashboard to show receivables data with bank mapping, pre/post settlement amounts for cash flow transparency, and filters on Receivables & Payables pages.

**Implementation:**

**1. Treasury Dashboard Enhancements:**
- **Pre-Settlement Balance**: Shows actual balance with settled payments only
- **Post-Settlement Balance**: Shows projected balance including pending settlements  
- **Cash Flow by Bank Account** table: Opening balance, settled inflows, pending inflows, outflows, current/projected balance per bank
- **Bank Filter**: Filter all data by specific bank account
- **Quick Links**: Clickable cards to navigate to Receivables/Payables

**2. Receivables Page Filters:**

1. Create a `finance_clt_receivables` entry with all payment details
2. Link the receivable to the verification via `receivable_id`
3. Handle null payment_method gracefully
4. Store verification source for audit trail

**Result:** Approved payments now appear in Finance > CLT > Receivables page.

- User needs to configure production domain for OAuth

### Session Mar 1, 2026 (Part 2) - Finance Verification Flow Fix

#### P0: Finance Verification Data Pipeline Fix (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** When a lead was enrolled, the finance verification record was being created without crucial payment details (payment method, course name, payment screenshot, split payment details, BNPL phone verification). This was blocking the finance team from verifying payments.

**Root Cause:** The `LeadUpdate` Pydantic model in `server.py` was missing the payment-related fields, causing them to be filtered out before reaching the finance verification creation logic.

**Solution:**
Extended the `LeadUpdate` model to include all payment fields:

```python
class LeadUpdate(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    # Payment fields for enrollment
    payment_method: Optional[str] = None
    payment_amount: Optional[float] = None
    payment_date: Optional[str] = None
    payment_proof: Optional[str] = None  # Base64 encoded image
    payment_proof_filename: Optional[str] = None
    payment_notes: Optional[str] = None
    transaction_id: Optional[str] = None
    # Split payment support
    is_split_payment: Optional[bool] = False
    payment_splits: Optional[List[dict]] = None
    # BNPL phone verification
    bnpl_phone: Optional[str] = None
    bnpl_same_number: Optional[bool] = True
```

**Key Changes:**
- Backend: `/app/backend/server.py` - Added 12 new fields to LeadUpdate model (lines 310-343)
- Backend: Updated finance verification record creation to properly capture course_name (line 2871)
- The complete data flow now works: `EnrollmentPaymentModal` → `leadApi.update()` → `finance_verifications` collection

**Test Results:** Backend 100% (11/11 passed), Frontend 100%

#### P1: Meta Ads API Configuration (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** Meta Ads API credentials were not configured.

**Solution:**
Added Meta API credentials to backend `.env`:
- `META_APP_ID="755078850771503"`
- `META_APP_SECRET="742a5810f5fa474427d2ce843a67283b"`

**Result:**
- Meta Ads Service now initialized on server startup
- Marketing Settings page shows "Meta API: Configured" and "Webhook: Ready"

#### P0: Google Sheets Lead Connector (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** User needed to import leads from Google Sheets automatically with:
- Auto-sync every 5 minutes and manual sync option

**Test Results:** Backend 89% (16/18 passed, 2 skipped - OAuth not configured), Frontend 100%

#### P0: Lead Flow Refactoring (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** Meta Ads leads were going to a separate collection instead of the central Leads Pool. User wanted all leads (from Meta, Google Sheets, and future sources) to go to one central pool for SLA automation and round-robin distribution.

**Solution:**
1. **Deleted Meta Ads Leads page** (`/marketing/leads`) - removed from routes and navigation
2. **Updated Meta webhook** to save leads directly to main `leads` collection:
   - Duplicate detection by phone/email
   - Automatic round-robin agent assignment
   - Notification to assigned agent
   - Lead source marked as `meta_ads`
3. **Updated Marketing sidebar** - replaced "Meta Ads Leads" with "Lead Connectors"

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/frontend/src/App.js` - Updated routes
- `/app/frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx` - Updated sidebar navigation
- `/app/backend/server.py` - Modified `process_meta_webhook()` function

### Session Feb 27, 2026 - ESS Portal & Granular Access Control

#### P0: Granular Access Control System (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** The existing access control only allowed module-level permissions (e.g., view/edit entire "Sales CRM"). Users needed granular control at the sub-page and feature level.

**Solution:**
- Created new backend endpoints: `GET/PUT /api/roles/{role_id}/permissions` and `GET /api/user/permissions`

- Employees can click on any attendance date to request correction
- Original vs. requested times displayed
- Mandatory reason field
- Multi-level approval workflow

**ESS Dashboard on Main Dashboard:**
- Two tabs: "Work Dashboard" and "My Self-Service"
- Quick stats: Days Present, Hours Worked, Annual Leave Left, Pending Requests
- Tabs within ESS: Overview, Attendance, Leaves, Requests
- Widgets: Leave Balance, Weekly Attendance, Pending Requests, Assets, Request History
- Proper handling for users without HR employee records

**Backend Endpoints Created:**

**Test Results:** Backend 100% (13/13 passed), Frontend 100% (All features working)

### Session Feb 26, 2026 - BioCloud Sync & Payroll P0 Fixes

#### P0: BioCloud Attendance Sync Fix (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** The BioCloud attendance sync feature was broken because the target website (ZK BioCloud) had changed its UI structure. The Playwright scraping script was unable to find the menu elements.

**Solution:**
- Completely rewrote the `fetch_biocloud_attendance` function in `server.py`
- Changed navigation path from "Attendance > First & Last" to "Attendance > Daily Attendance"
- Updated scraping logic to handle layui table framework structure:
  - Uses `.layui-table-box` containers to find the daily attendance table
  - Parses columns: Employee ID | Weekday | Employee Name | Department Name | Punch Date | Actual In | Actual Out | Day off
  - Handles pagination by setting page size selector
- Now successfully fetches attendance data from https://56.biocloud.me:8085

**Test Results:**
- Fetched 50 records, synced 1 to CLT Synapse (49 unmapped employees skipped)
- BioCloud Status shows: 106 BioCloud Employees, 5 Mapped, 101 Unmapped

#### P1: Payroll Run Duplicate Key Fix (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** Running payroll for a month that already had a processed batch resulted in a MongoDB duplicate key error instead of a proper error message.

**Solution:**
- Changed the duplicate check from `hr_payroll` collection to `hr_payroll_batches` collection
- Now properly returns: "Payroll for 2026-02 already processed (status: paid)"

#### Bug Fix: EmployeeDetailsPage Syntax Error (COMPLETED)
**Problem:** EmployeeDetailsPage.jsx had orphaned duplicate code causing "Expected corresponding JSX closing tag" error.

**Solution:**
- Removed orphaned code block (lines 716-734) that had duplicate CardContent, Card, and TabsContent elements
- Also referenced a non-existent `calculateNet()` function

### Session Feb 24, 2026 - Admin Settings, Data Reset, Feature Flags

### Session Feb 22, 2026 - CS → Mentor CRM Data Flow

#### NEW: Customer Service to Mentor CRM Pipeline (COMPLETED)

**Flow:**
1. New students start in Customer Service CRM under "New Student" stage
